## annotate the transcript
#### insert ZH, normalisation and error/comment tiers
if you have finished transcribing the primary text, it is necessary to add further tiers (rows) for annotation.  
you will first add a tier, where a normalised version of the text will be the content. for that:
- add a new tier
- choose to \<copy events from\> the speaker tier and label it [norm]

now you have a copy of the speakerline called X [norm] with the same text.  
*normalisation* in this context means that you correct the text in that tier for and **just for** spelling (orthographic) errors (exluding interpunctuation mistakes).
#### insert a part of speech tier
